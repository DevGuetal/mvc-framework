This is an exercise I had to do. Basically, I was given to build a framework similar to Angularjs, that would provide a basic data binding mechanism

In order to view the result:

* simply click on index.html or copy the files and run them in a server (for example Mongoose, targetting localhost:8080)
* to see the 2 way data binding excercise, open the index_2way_data_binding.html
